# Analysis Reproduction
The analysis is divided into 5 separate files that you will have to run entirely and the results should follow from there, although per_tissue_type_regression is
isolated from the rest but might overlap in variables, thus it should be run completely on its own and not in between the running any of the other
 files so as not to overwrite other variables that are global.
